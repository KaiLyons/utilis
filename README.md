## The notepad that depends on your cookies
Utilis is a very simple site that will save any and all input to your cookies. This can be useful for writing down homework, or simply creating a draft for a new great story. 
File saving *is still under development*. I am also working on possible pages for other uses such as a planner to i.e. write down the date of your upcoming algebra quiz. [Any and all ideas are appreciated](mailto://ocean@bruhchan.xyz)
